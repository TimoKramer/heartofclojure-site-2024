    <h2>Leuven, Belgium</h2>

    <p>
      Heart of Clojure is a conference by and for the European Clojure Community, As such we
      chose a location that's easily accessible from across Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
      From Brussels Airport it's only a <strong class="pink-t60">fifteen minute train
      ride</strong> and a five minute walk to get to the venue. We encourage people from
      neighbouring countries to take the train. If you're coming from London, Paris,
      Amsterdam, or Cologne then you can ride comfortably up to our doorstep.

      Leuven is a university city with a rich past and plenty of hospitality to offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The historic center is largely <strong class="pink-t60">car-free</strong> and easily
      navigated on foot, making it a visitor friendly destination. With hundreds of years of
      history, <strong class="pink-t60">many local breweries</strong> and a small walkable core,
      it's a perfect playground for the community to mingle.

            venue</a> (10-20min). The <a class="hoc-link"

            most of August 1st and August 4th</strong>. While there are no specifics yet
            there will be some fringe activities before and after the conference
            that you might want to participate in.
