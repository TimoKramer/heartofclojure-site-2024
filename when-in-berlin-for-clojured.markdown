ClojureD is just around the corner and some of you might be staying in Berlin for a few more days, planning to explore the city. Because many of the people behind Heart of Clojure are also living in Berlin we have some ideas for you. :) 

If you want to hang out/make plans with fellow Clojurians, share your plans in the <code class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1 br2 f5 mr1">#clojured</code> or <code class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1 br2 f5 mr1">#clojure-berlin</code> [Slack channels](http://clojurians.net). The <code class="bg-light-gray ph2 pv1 br2 f5 mr1">#clojuredconf</code> hashtag on Twitter might be another good meeting spot.

<h2 class="mt5 mb3">Tempelhofer Feld</h2>

![Tempelhofer Feld](/img/tempelhof.jpg)

While it's certainly more enjoyable in summer Tempelhofer Feld might still be worth a stroll while you're in town. Take the U8 to Boddinstraße and walk through Schillerkiez past a nice selection of restaurants and cafes. 

The field itself is a huge flat piece of grass and asphalt (a former airfield heavily used during the [Berlin Blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade)) hosting community gardens and all kinds of sports, including windsurfing. 

A good place to play some frisbee or just enjoy a nice walk in the sun. Spring vibes are big in Berlin these days — and this is the place to catch some of that energy.

<h2 class="mt5 mb3">Markthalle Neun</h2>

![Street Food Thursdau](/img/street-food-thursday.jpg)

Every Thursday there's [Street Food Thursday](https://markthalleneun.de/veranstaltungen/81/2019/2/21/street-food-thursday) at Markthalle Neun. It's usually packed but a fun way to have different food and experience a bit of Berlin.

<h2 class="mt5 mb3">Exhibitions / History / Art</h2>

[**Hohenschönhausen Stasi Memorial**](https://www.stiftung-hsh.de). A bit off the beaten path but can be quite interesting if you're into history and would like to learn more about political persecution and oppression in East Germany. **To see the actual prison, you'll need to arrange a tour.**

[**nineties.berlin**](https://nineties.berlin/en) is a bit more on the entertainment side of exhibitions and tries to give you an idea about life in Berlin shortly after the fall of the wall.

[**Deutsches Technik Museum**](https://sdtb.de/museum-of-technology/623/) hosts an array of exhibitions technology focused exhibitions. Perhaps of particular interest they also display a replica of the [original Z1](https://sdtb.de/museum-of-technology/exhibitions/1256/), one of the first computers ever.

[**Berlin Unterwelten**](https://www.berliner-unterwelten.de/en.html) is a non profit organising tours through underground structures. I haven't been but everyone who has been told me it's amazing. Guided tours only & you might need to book in advance.

<h2 class="mt5 mb3">Food</h2>
Notably absent from this list so far are any restaurants. There's simply too much variety to pick out a handful of places. [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com) is working pretty well for Berlin if you have it. If you're looking for specific recommendations feel free to [ask on Twitter](https://twitter.com/martinklepsch).

<h2 class="mt5 mb3">Recover</h2>

Finally, if the weather isn't too nice or you're just looking for a a break a way from city life, [**Liquidrom**](https://liquidrom-berlin.de/en/) or [**Vabali**](https://www.vabali.de) would be decent options.

<h2 class="mt5 mb3">Have a great time!</h2>

Finally, no matter what you do, we hope to meet some of you at ClojureD and that you'll enjoy your stay in Berlin!

If you have any additions to this list reply to this tweet.

Best,  
Martin
