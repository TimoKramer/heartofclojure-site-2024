abstract: "To the mainstream public (devs and business folks), clojure is either seen as an arcane lisp, or as a hyped language. This perception of Clojure is further solidified by the fact that it's hard to get started with Clojure.\r\n\r\nClojure definitely has a very passionate community and undeniable strengths, then what is holding it back? \r\n\r\nBy openly discussing these issues and collborating on solutions, we can propel Clojure beyond it's current position as a powerful defacto business choice. There are many low hanging fruits and quick wins we can do to get the ball rolling."
