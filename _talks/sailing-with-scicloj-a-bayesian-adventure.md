abstract: The presentation, created in collaboration with Daniel Slutsky and the Scicloj community, discusses the Scicloj project and the data science tools for Clojure. Sami Kallinen shares his personal journey of learning to sail during the Covid-19 pandemic. The main focus of the presentation is on Polar diagrams, which are crucial for assessing a boat's performance, important for racing tactics and choosing the optimal sailing routes. The speaker has collected and analyzes various data points to create these diagrams for a 46-year-old Finnish half-tonner cruising sailboat with a classic design. The primary focus is on showcasing how Clojure's data science tools are used to analyze data and construct models, especially through Bayesian analysis.
