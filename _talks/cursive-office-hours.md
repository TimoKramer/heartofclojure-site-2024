- name: Colin Fleming
  biography: Colin is the developer of Cursive. He has programmed things for a long time now, in a bunch of different programming languages. When he's not hacking on Cursive, he's mostly climbing in the hills nearby.
abstract: Come with all your questions about Cursive! I have developed Cursive from the very start, and I'd love to hear your questions, see how you're using Cursive and (hopefully!) help you with any problems you're experiencing. Whether you're an experienced Cursive user, an experienced Emacs user curious about why anyone might want to use anything else, or anywhere in between those two points, I'd love to hear from you and help with any issues you're experiencing.
