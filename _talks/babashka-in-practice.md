type: Workshop
speakers:
- name: Teodor Heggelund
  biography: Teodor likes to program computers, especially with along other people. In previous lives, he has taught Elm to kids, Matlab and mechanics to students, and Python to civil engineers. His experience is that Clojure's interactivity makes it uniquely well suited to explore problems together.
abstract: "What is Babashka? Why should you care?\r\n\r\nIn 90 minutes you’ll get an introduction to Babashka, and hands-on experience with it through a shared programming experience with the rest of the group and two veteran Clojure programmers. You’ll learn what Babashka is, how it fits in with JVM Clojure, and how to work with it in a practical sense.\r\n\r\nThe workshop aims to be a joyful learning experience where we’ll get to know each other better and learn more about REPL-driven programming, testing Clojure, and, of course scripting with Babashka."
