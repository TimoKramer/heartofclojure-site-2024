title: Building Conversational Speech Annotation Tool in Clojure
type: Talk
speakers:
- name: Paweł Stroiński
  biography: I started programming in 1998 and never stopped since!
abstract: This talk will be a story of inheriting a bespoke text editor with annotation features written in ClojureScript and turning it into a number of things. It will include horror stories of debugging in-house Specter macros running in browser as well as calming stories of how nice it is to work in a code with a good test coverage even if it is difficult to approach, or how enjoyable it is to create interactive audio annotation tooling in ClojureScript.
