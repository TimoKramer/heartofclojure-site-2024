  biography: "Jeaye has a background in C++ systems programming, focusing on games and game engines. After several years of making games, he co-founded and built an e-sports tournament startup written in full-stack Clojure. These days, he’s writing Clojure at Electronic Arts (EA) to build tooling used for making some of the world’s top games.\r\n\r\nJeaye is the creator of the jank programming language, a Clojure dialect on LLVM with a native runtime and C++ interop."

abstract: "What would happen if we combine C++ with Clojure? Would the result be too dangerous for this world? Imagine a language that allows you to leverage Clojure's expressive, functional programming capabilities while tapping into the raw performance and system-level access of C++. That language is called jank. \r\n\r\nTogether, we'll discover how jank bridges the gap between the elegance of Clojure and the raw native power of C++ and why this seemingly dangerous combination might be the future of high-performance computing."
