title: 'Squint: a taste of Clojure for JavaScript devs'
type: Talk
speakers:
- name: Felix
  biography: Felix started his studies within biochemical technology but pivoted when his first software development course made him fall in love with programming. Since then he went through a Java bootcamp but was promptly thrown into the world of functional programming during his first employment using F# and Clojure. A brief dip into Golang for two years then cemented his views on functional paradigm that it was his way forward.
abstract: Diving head first into shadow-cljs and the surrounding ecosystem can be daunting. What if we could incrementally introduce Clojure into our existing JS applications from the safety of our favourite frontend frameworks like React or Svelte to tame its more complex logic - hopefully with the help of a trusted REPL
