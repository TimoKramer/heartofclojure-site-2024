abstract: "Starting in 2021, we naively took on the task of bringing mission-critical legacy systems in the automotive logistics sector into the modern era. \r\n\r\nThis experience report covers our eventually successful live migration from the IBM AS/400 to Clojure and Datomic. We look at both the technical and human organizational challenges we faced and share our failures and learnings along the way.\r\n\r\nThousands of globally unique 8-character column names, green-screen terminal UIs, skunk work projects and personal drama —  this talk has it all!"
