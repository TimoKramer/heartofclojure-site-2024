  title: Come with us now, on a journey through trigonometry and oscillation, to the world of the fragment shader
  abstract: One of the things Clojure is known for is its usage in creative coding, most notably live coding music. But what about visuals? Let us venture into the world of creative coding with fragment shaders and see for ourselves! Finally a use case for some of the math you learnt in school! And of course, there is some Clojure involved.

  title: Does Clojure Wear Prada?
  abstract: Neural networks view the world through the lense of their training data, just as people approach the world with unique viewpoints shaped by past experiences and knowledge. What happens when you apply a previous professional experience with Clojure to a current professional interest in fashion and try to learn about machine learning in the process; In this talk we’ll discuss the process, pitfalls, and pleasures of starting out in ML using Clojure in order to explore a completely different field.

  abstract: >-
    Open Source Software (OSS) has created enormous value for individuals and businesses. However the creators of that software often capture a tiny fraction of that value, and can end up tired, burnt out, or quitting the project entirely.
    <br>
    Clojurists Together is an organisation that supports critical OSS Clojure software. This talk will discuss different ways of funding OSS, the missing ‘open source middle-class’, why we don't buy an Enterprise Edition of a banana, the benefits of funding OSS for all parties, and some future directions for funding OSS that we think are promising.

    Fabrizio is a Software Engineer from Sardinia (Italy), currently helping good journalism with good functional programming at KSF Media in Helsinki, Finland. Lately he's into distributed systems, developer UX, and programming languages. In fact, he somehow ended up as a core contributor to the Dhall language. If you'd like to get him excited come talk and mention functional programming, fractals, electronic music, rockets, coffee or food.
  abstract: >-
    Have you ever wondered about how compilers work? I used to be scared of them. Big, complicated, magic programs. But they power our everyday lives and allow us to make the world a bit better with software. Oh, and it turns out there’s nothing magic to them.
    <br>
    In this talk we’ll wander in the land of parsers, typecheckers and normalizations. We’ll demonstrate that a compiler fits what Clojure is best at: transforming data. And we’ll live-code a small little compiler of our own in Clojure, for the simplest computation device we have: lambda calculus.

Displeased with the repetitive tasks involved in drafting complex legal documents, he created a startup (ClauseBase) that develops innovative contract drafting software.
  abstract: >-
    This talk will discuss how Clojure/script was used by a small team to create advanced drafting software for lawyers. It will first outline how lawyers currently draft contracts, and why this is a primarily manual process that has been almost resistant to real automation. It will then describe why Clojure/script was chosen, how its proclaimed benefits turned out in practice, and how Clojure/script was instrumental in transforming the software from a rough idea into a demo and then actual product. The talk concludes with pitfalls encountered and honest lessons learned.

    Sometimes we use code for work. Sometimes we use code for art. Sometimes we use code to generate art live — while our friends work it. La Habra is a Clojurescript based framework that helps me do the latter, while embracing both retro graphics and imperfection. Let's look at the framework and then code some graphics — live!

    This talk will introduce you to relevant, easy to grasp concepts of collaboration and communication as well as give you food for thought.

This is why I went back to what was familiar, in this case, a simple Java game I programmed, to help learn and better my understanding of coding in Clojure. In my talk I will present how I applied familiar concepts, searched for similarities and leveraged shared libraries in the process of re-coding a 2D Java game into Clojure. I will present enough code examples so by the end of this talk you won’t know how to win Pac-Man but you’ll be able to write it in Clojure

In his 22 years of experience he has personally  shipped more than 40 digital products and has ramped up global teams responsible  for planning, development and releasing hundreds of digital products.
  abstract: Resiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function. It is not about avoiding failures but accepting the fact that failures will happen and responding to them in a way that avoids downtime or data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully functioning state after a failure. In this talk we will take a look at some of the solutions, libraries, and implementation approaches available to the Clojure ecosystem for building resilient applications.

  abstract: >-
    Have you ever tried to simply look at something? To take in the colors and shapes, and nothing more? It's not as easy as it sounds. We tend to instantly interpret what we're seeing, to apply labels, categories, identifiers; a level of symbolic interpretation. This helps us to make sense of the world, but it can prevent us from seeing what's really there. Similarly, in a programming setting, we might find ourselves searching fruitlessly for a bug, only to realize it was in front of us all along.
    <br><br>
    Our mental state predisposes us to behave in certain ways. But what if that mental state was just a tool, much like a paint brush? To explore uncharted territory or discover the unexpected we need different modes of thinking. This talk will explore these different modes of thinking, how they apply to arts, engineering, and how to practice seeing things differently.

  title: My opensource project; It’s all about the code. Oh, wait, no it’s not...
  keynote: true
  abstract: >-
    When Rachel started using Drupal, she thought she knew what opensource was all about; the code. Through the last twelve years as a member of the community, a contributor, a mentor and eventually Community Liaison for the Drupal Association, she has learned that, actually, great code is only a tiny part of what makes a great project.
    <br><br>
    Fundamentally, all open source projects are about people; those that create the code, those that help other to understand and use it, those that encourage its use and those that keep all these people working effectively together.
    <br><br>
    She will take a whole series of assumptions that she has herself made or observed others expressing during that time and look at what lessons she has learned that made her realise things are quite different.
    <br><br>
    Learning from these lessons has shaped how she approaches her work and she hopes those lessons are useful to others (and maybe she will learn a few more lessons, too!)

  bio: >-
    Rachel Lawson is the Community Liaison at the <a class="link pink-t60" href="https://www.drupal.org/association">Drupal Association</a>, providing a contact between Drupal community members worldwide and the Drupal Association which is the non-profit at the heart of supporting the project with technical, fundraising, community and product marketing resources and leadership.
    <br><br>
    Rachel has been fortunate to take a wonderfully varied route to this position; starting her career not in tech at all but teaching fencing. Taking the jump into tech via a teaching post, she has worked in the defence, finance and pharmaceutical sectors before finally discovering Drupal and becoming a full-time web developer.
    <br><br>
    Realising that the best way to improve her career in opensource is always to “get involved”, she became a contributor to the Drupal project and found herself moving naturally into mentoring others to contribute.
    <br><br>
    In 2017, Rachel joined the Drupal project’s Community Working Group, helping community members to resolve differences and abide by the Code of Conduct. This led eventually to her taking the new role of Community Liaison at the Drupal Assiciation.

    Have you ever asked yourself how did you end up with a big ball of mud? It doesn't have to be like that. What's preventing us from using rapid prototyping techniques aligned with a MVP mindset during your daily coding? I want to show, based on hands-on experience, how we can build apps that are simple, maintainable and enjoyable to work on. We'll cover a few concepts ranging from DDD, hexagonal architecture, accidental vs essential complexity to the MVP mindset. By building a practical example in Clojure, we will understand concepts, once abstract, turn into reality for your next project.
